Prize Awarding:

The system retrieves the list of all online players.
A player is randomly selected from this list.
The selected player receives the specified prize amount.
A message is sent to the configured Discord webhook announcing the winner.
Scheduled Execution:

The system checks the current time every minute.
If the time matches the specified hour and minute (e.g., 18:00), the awardDailyPrize function is executed.
Debug Command:

The debugdailyprize command allows administrators to manually trigger the prize awarding process.
This is useful for testing and verifying that the system is functioning correctly.
